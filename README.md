# libsignal-service-rs

![Build Status](https://github.com/whisperfish/libsignal-service-rs/workflows/CI/badge.svg)
[![API Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-libsignal--service-blue)](https://whisperfish.github.io/libsignal-service-rs/libsignal_service)

A Rust version of the [libsignal-service-java][lsj] library for communicating
with Signal servers.

## Supported Rust versions

`libsignal-service-rs` is used mostly by [Whisperfish](https://gitlab.com/whisperfish/whisperfish/),
a SailfishOS application.
The SailfishOS Rust compiler is relatively old, and therefore the MSRV for `libsignal-service-actix` maps on the compiler for that operating system,
including some lag.
At moment of writing, this is **Rust 1.52.1**.
For `libsignal-service-hyper`, we don't mandate MSRV.

## Contributing

We're actively trying to make `libsignal-service-rs` fully functional.

If you're looking to contribute or want to ask a question, you're more than welcome to join our development channel on Matrix (#whisperfish:rubdos.be) or Freenode (#whisperfish) to get in touch with us!

## Feature flags for libsignal-service

| Feature flag     | Description                                                                                                                                                                             |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `unsend-futures` | This feature removes the `Send` requirement on returned futures. Enabling this flag may be necessary for interoperability with other libraries that don't support `Send` such as actix. |
| `prefer-e164`    | This is a legacy feature that should not be used in new applications.                                                                                                                   |
