# libsignal-service-rs

[![Build Status](https://github.com/whisperfish/libsignal-service-rs/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=main)][ci_workflow]
[![API Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-libsignal--service-blue)][rustdocs]

A Rust version of the [libsignal-service-java][lsj] library which implements the core functionality to communicate with [Signal][signal] servers. It is based on the official Rust version of [libsignal][lsg]

## Usage

Usage of this library is not as straight-forward as with any other Rust library as it only provides some primitives.

For a higher-level library that helps you immediately get started with implementing a [Signal][signal] client in Rust, you might want to have a look at [Presage][presage],  which implements the traits of this library as well as local storage.

### Working around the issue with `curve25519-dalek`

`libsignal-service` depends on a forked version of `curve25519-dalek`,
which might conflict with other instances/forks of the library.

We advise you override all instances of said library through a `patch`-section.

The example below serves as an example of how this library can be included in `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
libsignal-service = { git = "https://github.com/whisperfish/libsignal-service-rs", branch = "main" }
libsignal-service-actix = { git = "https://github.com/whisperfish/libsignal-service-rs", branch = "main" }

libsignal-protocol = { git = "https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal-client", branch = "main" }
zkgroup = { version = "0.9.0", git = "https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal-client", branch = "main" }

[patch.crates-io]
"curve25519-dalek" = { git = "https://github.com/signalapp/curve25519-dalek", branch = "lizard2" }
```

If you're using a Cargo workspace, you should add the `[patch.crates.io]` section in the root `Cargo.toml` file instead.

### Note on supported Rust versions

`libsignal-service-rs` is the at the core of [Whisperfish][whisperfish], a SailfishOS application. The SailfishOS Rust compiler is relatively old, and therefore the MSRV for `libsignal-service-actix` maps on the compiler for that operating system, including some lag. At moment of writing, this is **Rust 1.61**.

For other platforms, we don't mandate MSRV.

## Contributing

We're actively trying to make `libsignal-service-rs` fully functional.

## Feature flags for libsignal-service

| Feature flag     | Description                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `unsend-futures` | This feature removes the `Send` requirement on returned futures. Enabling this flag may be necessary for interoperability with other libraries that don't support `Send` such as actix. |
